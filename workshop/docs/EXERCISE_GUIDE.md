## Exercise 2: Agentic Design Patterns

**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Type**: Lecture + Design Activity

### Learning Objectives

- Understand centralized vs decentralized architectures
- Learn when to use each pattern
- Design multi-agent systems effectively

### Centralized Multi-Agent Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│   Orchestrator Agent         │
│   (Central Coordinator)      │
└──────────┬───────────────────┘
           │
     ┌─────┼─────┐
     │     │     │
     ▼     ▼     ▼
  ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐
  │ A │ │ B │ │ C │  Specialized Agents
  └───┘ └───┘ └───┘
```

**Characteristics:**

- Single coordinator makes decisions
- Specialized agents report back
- Clear delegation of tasks
- Easier to debug and reason about

**Use When:**

- Clear task hierarchy
- Need global coordination
- Sequential workflows
- Single source of truth needed

**Example**: Service provisioning workflow

- Orchestrator receives user request
- Delegates to Planning Agent
- Delegates to Provisioning Agent
- Returns final result

### Decentralized Multi-Agent Architecture

```
  ┌───┐     ┌───┐
  │ A │────▶│ B │
  └─┬─┘     └─┬─┘
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
  ┌───┐     ┌───┐
  │ C │────▶│ D │
  └───┘     └───┘
```

**Characteristics:**

- Agents communicate peer-to-peer
- No single coordinator
- Emergent behavior
- More complex to reason about

**Use When:**

- No clear hierarchy
- Parallel problem solving
- Distributed decision making
- Resilience to failures

**Example**: Network monitoring

- Multiple monitoring agents watch different regions
- Agents share information
- Decisions emerge from collaboration

### Decision Framework

Ask yourself:

1. **Is there a clear workflow?** → Centralized
2. **Do tasks depend on each other?** → Centralized
3. **Need global state management?** → Centralized
4. **Need resilience to coordinator failure?** → Decentralized
5. **Problem naturally parallel?** → Decentralized

### Design Activity

**Scenario**: Design an agent system for network capacity planning

**Requirements**:

- Monitor network utilization
- Predict future capacity needs
- Recommend upgrades
- Execute capacity changes

**Task**: Draw your architecture (centralized or decentralized) and justify your choice.

**Things to consider**:

- How do agents share information?
- Who makes final decisions?
- What happens if an agent fails?
- How do you test the system?

### Discussion

Share your designs with the group. Compare approaches.

## Exercise 3: Segmentation of Responsibilities

**Duration**: 25 minutes  
**Type**: Lecture + Analysis

### Learning Objectives

- Learn to divide agent responsibilities effectively
- Understand domain vs task segmentation
- Avoid common anti-patterns

### Segmentation Strategies

#### 1. Domain-Based Segmentation

Divide by business domains or knowledge areas.

**Example**:

- **Network Topology Agent**: Knows about nodes, edges, connections
- **Capacity Agent**: Knows about utilization, violations, planning
- **Service Agent**: Knows about provisioning, lifecycle, SLAs

**Pros:**

- Clear expertise boundaries
- Easy to add new domains
- Specialists can be optimized independently

**Cons:**

- May need coordination across domains
- Potential duplication of knowledge

#### 2. Task-Based Segmentation

Divide by workflow tasks.

**Example**:

- **Planning Agent**: Computes routes, checks feasibility
- **Provisioning Agent**: Creates services, validates results
- **Monitoring Agent**: Tracks health, detects issues

**Pros:**

- Clear workflow mapping
- Easy to follow execution path
- Natural checkpoints between stages

**Cons:**

- Agents may need multiple knowledge domains
- Can lead to monolithic agents

#### 3. Hybrid Segmentation

Combine both approaches.

**Example**:

- **Planning Agent**: Task (planning) + Domain (routing knowledge)
- **Provisioning Agent**: Task (provisioning) + Domain (service API)
- **Topology Expert**: Domain only (consulted by other agents)

### Our Workshop Architecture

We'll use **task-based segmentation** with domain expertise:

```
User Request
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Support Agent   │  No tools, just documentation
│ (Exercise 4)    │  Helps users understand system
└─────────────────┘

User Service Request
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Planning Agent  │  Tools: get_nodes(), compute_route()
│ (Exercise 6)    │  Finds viable path
└─────────┬───────┘
          │ Path
          ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Provisioning    │  Tools: create_service()
│ Agent (Ex. 7)   │  Provisions on network
└─────────────────┘
```

**Why this works**:

- Clear task boundaries (plan vs provision)
- Minimal inter-agent communication
- Easy to test independently
- Natural workflow progression

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### ❌ God Agent

```python
class NetworkGodAgent:
    """Does everything - planning, provisioning, monitoring, etc."""
```

**Problem**: Too complex, hard to maintain, slow to execute

#### ❌ Chatty Agents

```python
# Agent A calls Agent B which calls Agent C which calls Agent A...
```

**Problem**: Circular dependencies, hard to debug, slow

#### ❌ Overlapping Responsibilities

```python
class PlanningAgent:
    def provision_service(self):  # Wait, this isn't planning!
```

**Problem**: Unclear boundaries, testing difficulty

#### ❌ Tool Sprawl

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    tools = [tool1, tool2, ..., tool50]  # 50 tools!
```

**Problem**: Agent gets confused, slow tool selection

### Best Practices

✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one clear job
✅ **Minimal Tools**: Give agents only what they need
✅ **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined inputs and outputs
✅ **Independent Testing**: Each agent testable alone
✅ **Obvious Names**: Name reflects responsibility

### Activity: Analyze This Design

Given this agent:

```python
class NetworkAgent:
    """Handles all network operations."""
    tools = [
        get_nodes, get_edges, get_services,
        create_service, delete_service,
        compute_route, check_capacity,
        send_email, log_event, generate_report
    ]
```

**Questions**:

1. What responsibilities does this agent have?
2. How would you split it?
3. What would you name the new agents?
4. Which tools would each agent get?

---

## Exercise 4: Build User Support Agent

**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Type**: Hands-on Coding

### Learning Objectives

- Create an agent without tools
- Practice prompt engineering
- Implement context management
- Handle multi-turn conversations

### Background

The support agent helps workshop participants:

- Understand the network simulator
- Learn SDK usage
- Get hints for exercises
- Troubleshoot common issues

**Key Constraint**: No tools! This agent uses only its knowledge and context.

### Part A: Understanding the Agent Structure (10 min)

Open `templates/support_agent_starter.py`:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import os

# Load documentation
WORKSHOP_DOCS = """
[Documentation about network simulator, SDK, exercises]
"""

# Create agent
support_agent = Agent(
    name="WorkshopSupportAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful workshop assistant...",  # TODO: Improve this!
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
    # Note: No tools parameter - this agent is conversation-only
)
```

**Key components**:

1. **Documentation**: Embedded in system prompt
2. **Instructions**: How the agent should behave
3. **No tools**: Pure conversation-based help

### Part B: Improve the System Prompt (15 min)

Your task: Make the agent more helpful by improving the instructions.

**Requirements**:

- Knows about the network simulator (48 nodes, 200 edges)
- Can explain SDK methods
- Gives exercise hints without full solutions
- Stays in scope (doesn't pretend to have tools)

**Example improvements**:

```python
instructions="""
You are a helpful workshop assistant for "Building AI Agents for Smarter Networks".

Your role:
- Help participants understand the network simulator and SDK
- Provide hints and guidance for exercises
- Explain concepts clearly with examples
- Stay encouraging and patient

About the network:
- 48 nodes across eastern US
- ~200 bidirectional edges
- Real geographic distances
- Capacity constraints (nodes and edges)

SDK key methods:
- client.get_nodes() - retrieve network nodes
- client.compute_route() - find paths with A* algorithm
- client.create_service() - provision services
[Add more...]

Guidelines:
- Give hints, not complete solutions
- If asked about tools, explain the agent doesn't have them
- For code questions, show small examples
- Encourage experimentation

What you DON'T do:
- Execute code or call APIs
- Access the actual network
- Provide complete exercise solutions
"""
```

### Part C: Add Context Management (10 min)

Handle context by including relevant documentation:

```python
def get_relevant_context(query: str) -> str:
    """Return documentation relevant to the query."""
    query_lower = query.lower()

    contexts = {
        "node": NODE_DOCUMENTATION,
        "edge": EDGE_DOCUMENTATION,
        "route": ROUTING_DOCUMENTATION,
        "service": SERVICE_DOCUMENTATION,
        "exercise": EXERCISE_HINTS,
    }

    # Simple keyword matching
    for keyword, context in contexts.items():
        if keyword in query_lower:
            return context

    return GENERAL_DOCUMENTATION
```

### Part D: Test Your Agent (10 min)

Test with these queries:

```python
from agents import Runner

# Test 1: Basic network info
result = Runner.run_sync(support_agent, "How many nodes are in the network?")
print(result.final_output)

# Test 2: SDK usage
result = Runner.run_sync(support_agent, "How do I find a route between two nodes?")
print(result.final_output)

# Test 3: Exercise hint
result = Runner.run_sync(support_agent, "I'm stuck on Exercise 6. Can you help?")
print(result.final_output)

# Test 4: Follow-up questions
result = Runner.run_sync(support_agent, "What is the Planning Agent supposed to do?")
print(result.final_output)
```

### Success Criteria

Your agent should:

- Answer network topology questions correctly
- Explain SDK methods with examples
- Provide helpful hints for exercises
- Maintain context across conversation turns
- Admit when it doesn't have tools/access

### Key Takeaways

- Agents can be useful without tools
- System prompts are crucial for agent behavior
- Context management improves relevance
- Testing is essential

## Exercise 5: Network Problem Introduction

**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Type**: Lecture + Exploration

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the network topology
- Learn network data structures
- Explore SDK capabilities
- Prepare for agent building

### The Network Problem

**Scenario**: You manage a telecommunications network across the eastern United States. You need to:

1. Find viable paths between endpoints
2. Check capacity constraints
3. Provision services
4. Monitor network health

### Network Topology

**Geographic Coverage**: Eastern US (48 cities)

- Major hubs: NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Atlanta, Miami
- Secondary cities: Albany, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Charleston, etc.
- Real lat/lon coordinates

**Connection Model**:

- Bidirectional edges between nodes
- Variable capacity (50-100 Gbps typical)
- Geographic distance matters
- Current utilization ~6%

### Data Structures

#### Node Object

```python
node.uuid = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
node.name = "Albany-NY"
node.latitude = 42.6526
node.longitude = -73.7562
node.vendor = "Suomi Networks"
node.capacity_gbps = 454.0
node.free_capacity_gbps = 449.5  # Available bandwidth
```

#### Edge Object

```python
edge.uuid = "ec4250e0-..."
edge.node1_uuid = "550e8400-..."
edge.node2_uuid = "6ba7b810-..."
edge.capacity_gbps = 69.7
```

#### Service Object

```python
service.uuid = "service-123"
service.name = "Service Albany to Boston"
service.source_node_uuid = "550e8400-..."
service.destination_node_uuid = "6ba7b810-..."
service.demand_gbps = 5.0
service.hop_count = 2
service.path_node_uuids = ["550e8400-...", "middle-...", "6ba7b810-..."]
service.path_edge_uuids = ["edge1-...", "edge2-..."]
service.total_distance_km = 257.3
```

### Available SDK Functions

See [NETWORK_REFERENCE.md](NETWORK_REFERENCE.md) for complete details.

**Key functions you'll use:**

1. `client.get_nodes()` - Get all network nodes
2. `client.get_edges()` - Get all connections
3. `client.compute_route()` - A\* pathfinding with capacity check
4. `client.create_service()` - Provision a service
5. `client.get_edge_utilization()` - Check capacity usage
6. `client.get_capacity_violations()` - Find oversubscribed edges

### Exploration Activity

Run this exploration script:

```python
from network_simulator_client import NetworkSimulatorClient

with NetworkSimulatorClient()  # Uses BACKEND_URL from environment as client:
    # 1. Network overview
    stats = client.get_database_stats()
    print(f"Network: {stats.nodes} nodes, {stats.edges} edges, {stats.services} services")

    # 2. Examine nodes
    nodes = client.get_nodes()
    print(f"\nSample nodes:")
    for node in nodes[:5]:
        print(f"  {node.name}: {node.capacity_gbps:.0f} Gbps ({node.free_capacity_gbps:.0f} free)")

    # 3. Find a route
    route = client.compute_route(nodes[0].uuid, nodes[-1].uuid, demand_gbps=5.0)
    print(f"\nSample route from {nodes[0].name} to {nodes[-1].name}:")
    print(f"  Distance: {route.total_distance_km:.1f} km")
    print(f"  Hops: {route.hop_count}")
    print(f"  Min capacity: {route.min_available_capacity:.1f} Gbps")
    print(f"  Computation time: {route.computation_time_ms:.2f} ms")

    # 4. Check network health
    violations = client.get_capacity_violations()
    high_util = client.get_high_utilization_edges(threshold_pct=80.0)
    print(f"\nNetwork health:")
    print(f"  Capacity violations: {len(violations)}")
    print(f"  High utilization edges (≥80%): {len(high_util)}")
```

### Capacity Constraints

**Why they matter**:

- Can't route more traffic than edge capacity
- Must check available capacity before provisioning
- Services consume capacity on all edges in their path

**Example**:

- Edge has 100 Gbps capacity
- Currently 60 Gbps used (60% utilization)
- Can add up to 40 Gbps more services
- Adding a 50 Gbps service would violate capacity

### Routing Algorithm

The network uses **A\* pathfinding**:

- Finds shortest geographic path
- Respects capacity constraints
- Very fast (~0.6ms computation time)
- Returns complete path with all intermediate nodes

**What it does**:

1. Start at source node
2. Consider all neighbors
3. Pick next node based on distance + heuristic
4. Only use edges with enough capacity
5. Continue until reaching destination
6. Return ordered list of nodes and edges

---

## Exercise 6: Build Planning Agent

**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Type**: Hands-on Coding

### Learning Objectives

- Integrate network tools into an agent
- Implement pathfinding logic
- Handle capacity constraints
- Format agent outputs

### Background

The Planning Agent finds viable paths between network endpoints.

**Input**: Source and destination nodes, bandwidth demand
**Output**: Formatted path with capacity validation
**Tools**: Network query functions

### Part A: Review Starter Code (10 min)

Open `workshop/ex2_planning_agent.py`:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from network_simulator_client import NetworkSimulatorClient

# TODO: Create tool functions
@function_tool
def get_network_nodes():
    """Get all network nodes."""
    # Your code here
    pass

@function_tool
def find_route(source_uuid: str, destination_uuid: str, demand_gbps: float):
    """Find route between nodes."""
    # Your code here
    pass

# TODO: Create agent
planning_agent = Agent(
    name="NetworkPlanningAgent",
    instructions="""
    TODO: Write a system prompt
    """,
    model=OpenAIResponsesModel(model=GENERATIVE_MODEL, openai_client=llm_client),
    tools=[
        ...
    ],
)
```

### Part B: Implement Network Tools (20 min)

Create tool functions the agent can call:

**Tool 1: Get Network Nodes**

```python
def get_network_nodes():
    """
    Get all network nodes with their details.

    Returns a list of nodes with name, UUID, capacity, and location.
    """
    client = NetworkSimulatorClient()  # Uses BACKEND_URL from environment
    nodes = client.get_nodes()
    client.close()

    # Format for agent consumption
    result = []
    for node in nodes:
        result.append({
            "uuid": node.uuid,
            "name": node.name,
            "capacity_gbps": node.capacity_gbps,
            "free_capacity_gbps": node.free_capacity_gbps,
            "location": f"{node.latitude}, {node.longitude}"
        })

    return result
```

**Tool 2: Find Route**

```python
def find_route(source_uuid: str, destination_uuid: str, demand_gbps: float = 5.0):
    """
    Find a route between two nodes with capacity check.

    Args:
        source_uuid: UUID of source node
        destination_uuid: UUID of destination node
        demand_gbps: Required bandwidth in Gbps

    Returns:
        Route information with path and capacity details
    """
    client = NetworkSimulatorClient()  # Uses BACKEND_URL from environment

    try:
        route = client.compute_route(source_uuid, destination_uuid, demand_gbps)

        result = {
            "success": True,
            "path_nodes": route.path_node_uuids,
            "path_edges": route.path_edge_uuids,
            "distance_km": route.total_distance_km,
            "hop_count": route.hop_count,
            "min_capacity_gbps": route.min_available_capacity,
            "computation_time_ms": route.computation_time_ms
        }

        client.close()
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        client.close()
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

### Part C: Write Agent Instructions (15 min)

Create clear instructions for the agent...

### Part D: Test Your Agent (15 min)

Test with various scenarios:

**Test 1: Simple route by name**

```python
result = Runner.run_sync(
    planning_agent,
    "Find a route from Albany-NY to Boston-MA with 5 Gbps demand"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Test 2: Route with UUID**

```python
# Get node UUIDs first
client = NetworkSimulatorClient()  # Uses BACKEND_URL from environment
nodes = client.get_nodes()
source = nodes[0]
dest = nodes[-1]
client.close()

result = Runner.run_sync(
    planning_agent,
    f"Find a route from {source.uuid} to {dest.uuid} with 10 Gbps demand"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Test 3: High demand (may fail)**

```python
result = Runner.run_sync(
    planning_agent,
    "Find a route from Albany-NY to Miami-FL with 100 Gbps demand"
)
print(result.final_output)
# Should explain insufficient capacity
```

**Test 4: Different node pairs**

```python
result = Runner.run_sync(
    planning_agent,
    "What nodes are available? Then find a route between two of them"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

### Success Criteria

Your agent should:

- Find routes given node names or UUIDs
- Check capacity constraints
- Return well-formatted paths
- Handle errors gracefully (no route found, etc.)
- Work across multiple conversation turns

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Agent doesn't call tools

- Check tool function signatures match expectations
- Ensure docstrings clearly describe what tools do
- Verify tools are in the agent's tools list

**Issue**: Route finding fails

- Check that source and destination UUIDs are valid
- Verify the API is running (curl ${BACKEND_URL}/health)
- Try a smaller demand_gbps value

**Issue**: Agent output is messy

- Improve the output format section in instructions
- Give example outputs
- Ask agent to use specific formatting

### Key Takeaways

- Tools are functions the agent can call
- Clear docstrings help agent use tools correctly
- Instructions guide agent behavior
- Output formatting requires explicit guidance
- Error handling is crucial

## Exercise 7: Build Provisioning Agent

**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Type**: Hands-on Coding

### Learning Objectives

- Create service provisioning tools
- Parse planning agent output
- Validate before provisioning
- Handle provisioning errors

### Background

The Provisioning Agent creates services on planned paths.

**Input**: Path from Planning Agent, service parameters
**Output**: Provisioned service confirmation
**Tools**: Service creation and validation functions

### Part A: Review Starter Code (10 min)

Open `workshop/ex3_provisioning_agent.py`:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from network_simulator_client import NetworkSimulatorClient, ServiceCreate
from datetime import datetime

    """Verify a service was created successfully."""
    # Your code here
    pass

# TODO: Create agent
provisioning_agent = Agent(
    name="ProvisioningAgent",
    instructions="You provision services on the network...",
    model=...,
    tools=[...]
)
```

### Part B: Implement Provisioning Tools (25 min)

**Tool 1: Create Service**

```python
def create_network_service(
    name: str,
    source_uuid: str,
    destination_uuid: str,
    demand_gbps: float,
    path_node_uuids: list,

```

### Part C: Write Agent Instructions (15 min)

```python
provisioning_agent = Agent(
    name="ProvisioningAgent",
    instructions="""
You are a network provisioning agent that creates services on planned paths.

Your job:
1. Parse path information from the planning agent
2. Validate all required parameters are present
3. Provision the service on the network
4. Verify successful provisioning

Tools available:
- create_network_service(...): Provision a service
- verify_service(uuid): Check service was created
- delete_network_service(uuid): Remove a service

Process:
1. Extract required parameters from the user's request:
   - Service name
   - Source and destination UUIDs
   - Demand in Gbps
   - Path nodes (list of UUIDs)
   - Path edges (list of UUIDs)
   - Total distance
2. Validate path structure (nodes = edges + 1)
3. Call create_network_service()
4. If successful, verify with verify_service()
5. Report results clearly

Output format:
Service provisioned successfully!
- Service UUID: [UUID]
- Name: [NAME]
- Path: [N] hops, [X] km
- Demand: [Y] Gbps
- Status: Active

If provisioning fails, explain why clearly.
""",
    tools=[...],
    model=...
)
```

### Part D: Test Your Agent (10 min)

**Test 1: Provision service from planning output**

First, get a route from planning agent:

```python
route_result = Runner.run_sync(
    planning_agent,
    "Find a route from Albany-NY to Boston-MA with 5 Gbps demand"
)
print("Planning Agent Output:")
print(route_result.final_output)
```

Then provision:

```python
provision_request = f"""
Provision a service called 'Workshop-Test-Service' using this plan:
{route_result.final_output}

Service requirements:
- Demand: 5 Gbps
- Name: Workshop-Test-Service
"""

result = Runner.run_sync(provisioning_agent, provision_request)
print("\nProvisioning Agent Output:")
print(result.final_output)
```

**Test 2: Verify service**

```python
# Extract service UUID from response
# Then verify
result = Runner.run_sync(
    provisioning_agent,
    f"Verify service {service_uuid}"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Test 3: Cleanup**

```python
result = Runner.run_sync(
    provisioning_agent,
    f"Delete service {service_uuid}"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

### Success Criteria

Your agent should:

- Parse planning agent output correctly
- Validate path structure before provisioning
- Successfully create services
- Verify provisioning completed
- Handle errors gracefully
- Support cleanup operations

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Can't parse planning output

- Make planning agent output more structured
- Add example parsing to provisioning agent instructions
- Use JSON format for inter-agent communication

**Issue**: Provisioning fails with validation error

- Check that path_nodes length = path_edges length + 1
- Verify all UUIDs are valid
- Ensure source/dest match first/last nodes in path

**Issue**: Service created but not verified

- Add delay before verification
- Check service UUID is correct
- Verify API connectivity

### Key Takeaways

- Provisioning requires careful validation
- Inter-agent communication needs structure
- Error handling prevents partial states
- Verification confirms operations succeeded

## Exercise 8: Iterative Improvement

**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Type**: Guided Practice

### Learning Objectives

- Improve agent prompts iteratively
- Optimize data flows
- Mitigate tool calling errors
- Test and debug agents

### Part A: Prompt Refinement (15 min)

#### Iteration 1: Too Vague

```python
instructions = "You help with networking."
```

**Problems**: Agent doesn't know what to do, how to do it, or when

#### Iteration 2: Too Specific

```python
instructions = """
First call get_nodes.
Then find node with name matching user input.
Then call find_route with those UUIDs.
Then format output with exactly 3 lines.
Line 1 must be 'Route found'
Line 2 must show distance
...
"""
```

**Problems**: Too rigid, can't handle variations, no flexibility

#### Iteration 3: Balanced

```python
instructions = """
You find network routes. When asked to route between nodes:
1. Identify source and destination (names or UUIDs)
2. Use get_nodes() if you need to look up names
3. Call find_route() with appropriate parameters
4. Return a clear summary of the route

Be helpful and adapt to the user's style.
"""
```

**Problems**: Just right! Clear but flexible.

#### Your Turn

Refine one of your agent prompts. Test before and after.

### Part B: Data Flow Optimization (15 min)

#### Anti-Pattern: Chatty Flow

```python
# Agent makes 10 separate API calls
for node in all_nodes:
    details = get_node_details(node.uuid)  # Slow!
```

#### Better: Batch Operations

```python
# Agent gets all data at once
all_nodes_with_details = get_all_nodes()  # Fast!
```

#### Anti-Pattern: Redundant Calls

```python
# Agent calls same function repeatedly
node1 = get_node(uuid)
# ... later ...
node1_again = get_node(uuid)  # Wasteful!
```

#### Better: Context Preservation

```python
# Agent remembers previous results
# Use conversation context or caching
```

#### Your Turn

Analyze your agents. How many tool calls do they make? Can you reduce it?

### Part C: Tool Calling Error Mitigation (15 min)

Common issues and solutions:

#### Issue 1: Wrong Parameter Types

```python
# Agent tries to call:
find_route("Albany-NY", "Boston-MA", ...)
# But expects UUIDs!
```

**Solution**: Clear docstrings

```python
def find_route(source_uuid: str, destination_uuid: str, demand_gbps: float):
    """
    Find route between nodes.

    Args:
        source_uuid: Node UUID (NOT name), example: "550e8400-..."
        destination_uuid: Node UUID (NOT name)
        demand_gbps: Bandwidth in Gbps (float), example: 5.0
    """
```

#### Issue 2: Missing Parameters

```python
# Agent calls:
create_service(name="test", source="...")
# Missing required params!
```

**Solution**: Required parameter documentation

```python
"""
ALL of these parameters are REQUIRED:
- name: Service name (string)
- source_uuid: Source node UUID
- ...
"""
```

#### Issue 3: Invalid Values

```python
# Agent calls:
find_route(source, dest, demand_gbps=-10)  # Negative!
```

**Solution**: Validation + instructions

```python
# In function:
if demand_gbps <= 0:
    return {"error": "Demand must be positive"}

# In instructions:
"demand_gbps must be a positive number, typically 5-100 Gbps"
```

#### Your Turn

Add better validation to your tools. Test with bad inputs.
